# Ockham.NET
Simple solutions to frequent .NET needs.

## Principles
 - Every Ockham module should solve a clear problem that is not solved in the .NET BCL, or in the particular libraries it is meant to augment.
 - **Ockham is not a framework**. Dependencies between Ockham modules shall be miminized.
 - Cloning, building, and modifying Ockham modules will be really, really easy.

## Contributing
 
Our work is guided by the principles and conventions described in detail in the `governance` folder:

  - **[Code of Conduct](./governance/CodeOfConduct.md)** - How we conduct ourselves
  - **[Principles](./governance/Principles.md)** - Guiding concepts for the Ockham.NET project
  - **[Conventions](./governance/Conventions.md)** - Agreed-upon coding style and structure conventions
  - **[Lifecycle](./governance/Lifecycle.md)** - Complete description of the process for proposing and implementing new solutions and APIs

All of these are underwritten by the **[Rules](./governance/Rules.md)** of the project.

## The Team

The project is guided by the current Maintainers. Contributors are people in addition to the Maintainers who may submit proposed API changes, implementations, bugfixes, and documentation.
